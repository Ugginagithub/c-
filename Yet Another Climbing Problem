/*Yet Another Climbing Problem
Program Description :
Tom is currently standing at stair 0 and he wants to reach stair numbered X.

He can climb either Y steps or 1 step in the move.

Find the minimum number of moves required by him to reach exactly the stair numbered X. 

Input Format :
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Only line of each test case consists of two integers X and Y denoting the number of stair Tom wants to reach and the number of stairs he can climb in one move respectively. 

Output Format :
For each test case, output the minimum number of moves required by him to reach exactly the stair numbered X.

Input :

Output :
2
4
3
2


Constraints :
1 ≤ T ≤ 500
