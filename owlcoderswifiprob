/*Owl Coders Wi-Fi Problem
Program Description :
Technical Hub organized Owl coder’s program, Where all students are assigned rooms to stay. There are N rooms in the Hostel ( In Straight line) . If there is a wifi in the ith room the room will be represented as 1 and if there is no wifi in the room it will be represented as 0. Each wifi has X range. (if a ith room has wifi then wifi can be shared with X rooms on its left as well as right)

Now you need to find whether students in all rooms can use wifi or not.

Input Format :
First line contains two integers N and X where N represents Number of rooms in hostel and X represents the range of wifi.

Second line contains a binary string S of 0’s and 1’s.

Output Format :
Print 1 if students in all rooms can use wifi other wise 0.

Input :
3 0

“010”


Output :
0*/
